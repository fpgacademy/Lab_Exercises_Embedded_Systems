The file part1 is an ARM executable. Usage:

part1 [-d] [-v] <BMP filename>
    -d: produces debug output for each stage
    -v: draws the input and output images on a video-out display
        
Using the optional debug argument -d causes the program to output a bmp file of the image 
after each stage of edge detection

Using the optional video argument -v causes the program to show the original image on a VGA
display. After the user presses return the edge-detected image is displayed. The -v option 
requires the driver /dev/IntelFPGAUP/video.

The edgedetect.c file is the skeleton code provided for this part of the exercise. It can 
be compiled by using the included Makefile.

Example output files for each stage of edge detection are provided, and more files can be
generated by using the program's -d option with the sample images.
