# Embedded Systems Laboratory Exercises

These laboratory exercises cover such topics as: introduction to ARM processors and FPGA systems, introduction to 
embedded Linux and code development in an embedded environment, memory-mapped I/O with virtual memory in user and 
kernel space, kernel modules (device drivers), interrupts, and I/O devices such as buttons, switches, lights, 
timers, accelerometers, audio, video, A/D, USB peripherals, and developing custom hardware systems in the FPGA.
